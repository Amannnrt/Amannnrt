I love diving deep into Machine Learning , Deep Learning , and Computer Vision . For me, learning isn’t just about memorizing—it’s about making connections. There’s nothing quite as satisfying as finally cracking a tough mathematical concept and seeing how it fits into the bigger picture.

Whether it’s training models, building systems that blend hardware and software, or reading research papers, I’m always chasing that “aha!” moment where everything clicks.
